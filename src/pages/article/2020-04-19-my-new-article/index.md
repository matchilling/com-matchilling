# DR. DEBORAH BIRX CALLS CHINA'S LOW CORONAVIRUS DEATH RATE 'UNREALISTIC'

President Donald Trump was not the only member of his administration's Coronavirus Task Force on Saturday to question China's very low death rate from the COVID-19 pandemic. His task force response coordinator had questions, even calling China's rate "basically unrealistic."

Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, displayed a graph that shows the mortality rates of countries around the world, and China is at the bottom with the lowest rate.

Belgium tops the list with a 45.2 percent mortality rate, with the United States close to the bottom at an 11.24 percent rate. Then there's China, with an asterisk next to its name, with 0.33 percent. Birx explained why China was on the chart, saying the country where coronavirus originated should have also been transparent when first dealing with the virus that became a global pandemic.
