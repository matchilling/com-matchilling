Tada :tada:, I finally found the time to migrate my personal website to a bit more modern and feature-richer engine. The current version uses [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), a react/ GraphQL based static progressive site generator built by Kyle Mathews which aims build to fast websites out-of-the-box using regular [Jam stack](https://jamstack.org/).


I will share my thoughts and experiences with GatsbyJs here in the blog, in the meanwhile check out the [Gatsby quick starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/) on GitHub.
