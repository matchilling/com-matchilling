![BREXIT - A !serious adventure for the Ununited Kingdom](./brexit-a-!serious-adventure-for-the-ununited-kingdom.gif)

Last month I found myself browsing through my abandoned git repositories and as it happened, I stumbled across one that caught my interest again for some reason.

The working title of that project was "[BREXIT - A !serious adventure for the Ununited Kingdom](https://github.com/matchilling/brexit)" and it turned out that it was a small text adventure written in Prolog, which intended to provide a humorous/ political satirically view on Brexit (term for UK's :uk: withdrawal from the European Union).

After cloning the repo and having played a little bit around with it, I took a brief look at the README.md, which contained an interesting section called "Ideas for further development" with the following bullet points:

- Open source the project and call for collaboration (e.g. add a new chapter every month)
- Two main story paths with a "remainder" and a "leaver" version
- Some AI, e.g. having a Chaos Nigel, who appears randomly in the game and insults the player for example based on their system settings (on debian, e.g. "Go apt-get a brain!")

Aha, that sounded fun (to me at least). Because I believe [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a wholly unique and unusual language compared with today's standard OO based languages, the idea of making it a collaborative project and involving people to develop the storyline further appealed to me as an interesting approach to introducing the language to those who maybe haven't used or heard about it.

## So this is a call for collaboration!

If you are keen to learn Prolog, refresh your logic programming skills or just like to be part of the project as a kind of recreational activity, then you are warmly welcomed to contribute to the project!

## Where to start

Arguably the best way to start is forking the [repository](https://github.com/matchilling/brexit), playing around with the current version and then to having a look at the code to understand what is going on under the hood.

_In case you are entirely new to the language check my [brief introduction to logic programming with Prolog](/introduction-to-logic-programming-with-prolog/)._

Regarding in what directions the storyline should be developed further I won't make any restrictions ~ I am just curious if people like the idea and want to contribute to the project.

**Just be creative!**
